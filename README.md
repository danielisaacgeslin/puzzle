## The rules of the game are the following:
> * You (the black and white circle) start at a customizable initial position
> <br/> ![Initial](screen-initial.png)
> * You can move using your keyboard's arrows (up/down/left/right)
> * Your objective is to move from the initial cell (yellow) to the target cell (green) before you run out of moves:
> <br/> ![Win](screen-win.png)
> * When you win, you will get a "You won" message and won't be able to move any more
> * If you do run out of moves before you reach the target cell, then you lose:
> <br/> ![Lose](screen-lose.png)
> * When you lose, you will get a "You lost" message and won't be able to move any more
